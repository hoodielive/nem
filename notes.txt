What is NodeJS?

Javascript runtime that uses the v8 Javascript engine 

Allows us to run JS on the server (Like PHP, Rails, Java, etc) 

Used to build very fast and scalable real-time applications 

Uses an event driven, non-blocking i/o model 


What can you do with it?

Manipulate files on the FS

Build web servers (respond to http requests) 

Query dbs (Mongo, MySQL, Postgres, Redis, etc) 

Powerful APIs & backend interfaces 

Powerful server side apps with rendered views 


Blocking Model vs Non-Blocking 

Blocking (you are blocked into one thing is finished):
	Upload the File
	Display the File
	Do Something Else

Non-Blocking (asynchronous code - do this while) -> Event Loop (Node is an event driven system) 
	Upload the file
	When its done do something else
	Do something else

Expand upon non-blocking code:
